<p><font color="#ffe84c">2.</font><font color="#ffffff">It is much like the game of tag that we all 
   remember and loved but with a twist of modern
   tech thrown in!</p></font>
<p><font color="#ffe84c">3.</font><font color="#ffffff">After registering, look for a game you want to 
   enter or start a new game and invite friends.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffe84c">4.</font><font color="#ffffff">Once in a game, look for the member glowing 
   GREEN to tag. (BLUE glowing members are NOT 
   eligible to be tagged and RED is the player that is 
   currently it!)</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffe84c">5.</font> <font color="#ffffff">In Tagya the winner is the last player standing.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffe84c">6.</font><font color="#ffffff">The only way to be open to get tagged is if a player uses his or her phone for whatever reason in other words if you decide to text a friend make a phone call or use your phone for any reason you just opened yourself up for a tag!</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffe84c">
<p><font color="#ffe84c">7.</font><font color="#ffffff"> Each member must show activity on each game 
   or that player will automatically be kicked from 
   the game (if a player has not used their phone 
   within 3 hours at a time, in other words, a player 
   must have some kind of activity on their phone 
   every 3 hours or less and if more than 3 hours 
   have passed with no activity then you 
   automatically are kicked from the game.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffe84c">8.</font><font color="#ffffff"> You may not tag back the player that has just 
   tagged you (no immediate tag backs).</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffe84c">9.</font><font color="#ffffff"> Your phone will alert you when you have been 
   tagged with a unique sound.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffe84c">10.</font><font color="#ffffff"> Game winner will be displayed at the end of each 
   game!</font></p>
   <p><font color="#ffe84c">11.</font><font color="#ffffff">Game-winner will be displayed at the end of each game and you will have to take a selfie to brag and show everyone that you just won!</font></p>
